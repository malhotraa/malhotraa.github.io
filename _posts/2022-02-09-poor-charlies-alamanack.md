* On Mental Models: 
    > You can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.
* Perverse Incentives aka Cobra effect: An incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result that is contrary to the intentions of its designers
* Pavlovian Association (aka Classical Conditioning): Theory on pairing  potent stimulus (ex: food) with a previously neutral stimulus (ex: bell). This causes neutral stimulus to produce the same response as potent stimulus. Ex: When a dog is given food it salivates. If dog is given food after ringing a bell eventually it salivates just on hearing the bell (no food).
    > If people tell you what you really don’t want to hear — what’s unpleasant —there’s an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it. It isn’t foredestined that you have to be this way. But you will tend to be this way if you don’t think about it.
* Operant Conditioning: Method that uses rewards and punishments for behavior. Using this an association is made between a behavior and a consequence.
* Social Proof: Monkey-see, monkey-do. People will emulate others behavior in some situations. Or people will conform in order to be liked, similar to, or accepted by another person.
* Play within your circle of competence:
    > You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose.
* Why appealing to interest is better than other persuasive tools:
    > It would've been child's play to get that job done right. All the general counsel had to do was to tell his boss, "John, this situation could ruin yourlife. You could lose your wealth. You could lose your reputation." And it would have worked. CEOs don't like the idea of being ruined, disgraced, and fired.
* Inversion: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward.
    > I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes
* Useful checklists:
  * The Two-Track Analysis (Pages 63, 64)
    * What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? (for example, macro and micro-level economic factors).
    * What are the subconscious influences, where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions? (influences from instincts, emotions, cravings and so on).
  * Interesting and Decision Making Checklist (Pages 73-76):
    Charlie's informal. but extensive. list of factors worthy of consideration.
  * Ultra-Simple, General Problem-Solving Notions (Pages 279-281):
    * Decide the big "no-brainer" questions first.
    * Apply numerical fluency.
    * Invert (think the problem through in reverse).
    * Apply elementary multidisciplinary wisdom, never relying entirely upon others.
    *  Watch for combinations of factors-the Lollapalooza effect.
  * Psychology-Based Tendencies (Pages 440-498):
    * Standard Causes of Human Misjudgment.

* Learn how to learn:
    > Just as civilization can progress only when it invents the method of
invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.
* On trust over bureacratic procedure:
    > The last idea that I want to give to you, as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure and some mumbo jumbo into what it does, is that complex bureaucratic procedure does not represent the highest reach. One higher form is a seamless, non-bureaucratic web of deserved trust. Not much fancy procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another.
