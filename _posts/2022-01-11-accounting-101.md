## Session 1

### Overview

Key questions:
* What do you own?
* What do you owe?
* How much money did you make?

Accounting statements:
* Balance sheet: What a firm owns and owes at a point in time => how much is the equity worth?
* Income statement: How much money did the firm make?
* Statement of cash flows: Records cash in and cash out

Balance sheet
* Assets
  * Fixed assets: Land, buildings, equipment, machinery
  * Current assets: Shorter life, inventory, accounts receivable, cash
  * Financial assets: Stocks bonds owned
  * Intangible assets: Non-physical assets, brand name, tech
* Liabilities
  * Current liabilities: Things owed in less than a year; accounts payable, debt due, supplier credit
  * Long term debt: bank loans, corporate bonds
  * Other liabilities: pension fund obligations, healthcare obligations
  * Equity: Variable; diff b/w assets and all other liabilities

Income statement
* Revenues: money made from selling products and goods
* Cost of goods sold: expenses associated with producting products/goods
* Revenues - COGS = Gross Profit
* Other operating expenses: Marketing, General & Administrative
* Gross profit - Other = Operating profit
* Financial expenses: Interest expenses
* Taxable income = operating profit - financial expenses
* Taxes: Taxes duej
* Net income = taxable income - tax

Statement of cash flows
* Cash flows from operations: Net income + depreciation + amortization + non-cash expenses

## Session 2

### Income Statements

Two ways to record income:
* Accrual accouting: Record transactions as they happen (not cash); most businesses use this
* Cash accounting: Record revenues as you get paid, record expenses as you spend them; only used by very small businesses

Expenses:
* Operating: Expenses for revenues generated this year; ex: labor, material
* Financing: Expenses associated with use of any capital which is not equity; ex: interest expenses on debt
* Capital: Expenses on items that create benefit over many years; ex: factory, equipment

![Expenses](/assets/images/expenses.png "Expenses")

Revenues:
* Record revenues as you sell products/services even if you havent been paid
* Revenues for products sold over many years might be broken into current and deferred
* Revenues break down by geography
* Revenues break down by business segment

Cost Of Goods Sold aka COGS: Expenses associated with producing product/service firm is selling
Other Operating Expenses: Expenses not tied directly to revenues; selling, advertising, marketing

Gross Profit = Revenues - COGS
Operating Income = Gross Profit - Other Operating Expenses

Selling, General & Administrative Costs aka SG&A: Everything else that cant be tied to individual product/service (ie kitchen sink)

Depreciation
* Economic: Equipment becomes less useful as its used; captures aging of the asset. Vary by type of asset and how its used
* Accounting: More mechanical; rule driven; driven by aging of the asset
* Tax: What tax authorities will allow as depreciation; Helps minimize taxes paid

Financing Expenses
* Interest expense on debt: Explicit for bank loans, corporate bonds, implicit for leases
* Sometimes above is netted out against interest income earned from cash and other financial investments and reported together

Income from non-operating investments
* Cash & Marketable securities: t-bills
* Investment in other companies:
  * Minority (upto 5%): Income will be recorded under operating income
  * Majority (50%+): Consolidate financials

Extraordinary income/expenses
* One time gains/loss from selling assets
* One time lawsuit
* Should show up only once in a while

## Session 3

### Balance Sheet

What should Balance Sheets capture?
* Record capital invested in current assets
* Record current value of assets
* Record liquidation value assuming you sold the assets today

Assets
* Fixed and Current Assets
  * Old way: Current value = Original cost - accounting depreciation
  * New way: Current market value
* Financial Assets
  * Holdings in other companies public or private
  * For public: Current value = current market price
  * Minority vs majority stakes
    * Majority stake (>50%): Full consolidation; Quite involved process to value; Assume 100% of subsidiary company's revenues and Op income included in parent company financials; not owned portion shown as non-controlling liability
    * Minority stake: Value depends on why the stake is being held? Holding for trading: value = current market value. Holding as long-term investment = book value
  * Intangible Assets
    * Goodwill: Not an asset; shows up after acquisition; measures difference b/w price paid for acquisition and target company's asset value
    * Goodwill Impairment: Records drop in value if money spent acquiring company was too much; Doesnt really impact markets as everyone already knows about it by the time it shows up on balance sheets

Liabilities
* Current
  * Non-interest-bearing: accounts payable, supplier credit
  * Interest-bearing: short-term borrowings, short term debt, short term portion of long term debt
  * Deferred items: Deferred revenues, salaries, fees, taxes
* Debt
  * Corporate bonds: debt raised from public markets
  * Bank loans: debt raised from banks or other lenders
  * Lease debt: debt due to leased stuff requiring payemnts in future years. Starting 2019, all leases are reported as lease debt
  * Debt details
    * When its due
    * Floating/fixed, straight/convertible (TODO: research these later)
    * Consolidated table for debt payments due by year
* Shareholder's Equity
    * Old way: Equity = starting equity + equity augmentations + retained earnings; reflects company's entire history
    * New way: Reflects history + marking up/down of items; makes it noisy and volatile
    * Equity can be affected by
      * Par value: Not useful anymore; ignore
      * Company age: Young companies have less shareholder's equity than older company's of equal market value
      * Capitalization effects: Some expenses like R&D, technology should be capitalized instead of being treated as Op expenses; this skews equity down
      * Buyback effects: Dividends and buybacks reduces shareholder's equity by amount spent to buyback shares
    
## Session 3A

![Balance Sheet Lifecycle](/assets/images/balance-sheet-life-cycle.png)

Accounting stuck b/w book value and fair value accounting. This makes lots of numbers on balance sheets unreliable. Most reliable numbers are Cash & marketable securities, Debt.

## Session 4

### Statement of Cash Flows

Primary Objective: How much cash balance of company changed during a period?

Other objectives: 
* Cash made/paid due to operations
* Cash invested back into business
* Cash raised/returned to debt/equity investors

Some other facts:
* +/- sign indicates positive/negative cash flows
* Statement of cash flows is from perspective of equity investors

#### Cash flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations = Start with net income  
\+ non-cash items like Depreciation, Amortization, others   
+/- accounts receivables, inventory, other current assets, accounts payables, taxes  

Non-cash working capital = non-cash current assets - Non-debt current liabilities
Increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows and vice versa

#### Cash flows from Investing

How much is the company investing into its business for growth?

* Investment in operating assets
  * How aggressively is company trying to grow in the future?   For growing companies capex is much greater than depreciation
  * Acquisitions done using shares dont show up in statement of cash flows
  * These investments drive growth in revenues, op income
* Investment in non-operating assets
  * These are also vaulable but dont show up in operating income line but below it

#### Cash flows from Financing

* Cash flow to/from debt
* Cash flow to/from equity

Debt cash flows
* Debt repayments
* Debt issuances

Equity cash flows
* Dividends
* Buybacks

Potential Dividends (aka Free Cash Flows to Equity or FCFE)
Its possible to calculate how much company could've paid in dividneds or used to buy back stock from the statements of cash flows.
FCFE after debt = 
Cash flow from operations  
- capex
+ divestitures of assets
- cash acquisitions
+ debt raised
- debt paid

## Session 3A

![Cash Flow Lifecycle](/assets/images/cash-flow-life-cycle.png)

Takeaways:
* As companies mature Cash flows from Operations will go form -ve -> +ve
* Companies optimistic about growth will be investing more than others. Cash flows from Investing will reflect this
* Financing cash flows show the mix of equity and debt and changes over time

## Session 5

### Taxes
* Marginal tax rate: ~21% federal + state taxes for US (as of 2020)
* Effective tax rate: From income statement, rate = taxes / taxable income
* Cash tax rate: Tax rate for taxes actually paid on taxable income

Deferred taxes
* Assets: Company pays less on taxes in the future
* Liabilities: Company pays more on taxes in the future

Operating Losses
* Net Operating Losses (NOL) can be carried forward to reduce taxes paid in future years

Stock based compensation
* Options
* Restricted shares
These should be treated as an operating expense for the company
Unlike depreciation, stock based compensation shouldnt be added back for computing cash flows according to Damodaran.

Leases are debt
* Since companies have to pay the rent in good times and bad times, just like bank loans
* Until 2019, there were two kinds of leases: Capital and Operating. Since 2019 all lease comittments are treated as debt

Capitalizing leases
* A little bit invovled. Refer [link](https://youtu.be/un6-H_wOizM?list=PLUkh9m2BorqmKaLrNBjKtFDhpdFdi8f7C&t=660) for more info

Other contractual commitments
* Purchase commitments for manufacturing firms
* Content commitments for streaming firms
* Player contracts for a sports team

R&D is cap ex
To capitalize R&D
* Step 1: How many years it takes for R&D to pay off
* Step 2: Collect R&D expenses from past years
* Step 3: For each of the past years of R&D:
  * How much will you be amortizing this year
  * How much of R&D expense remains unamortized
* Step 4: Adjust earnings by adding back current years R&D expense and subtracting amortization of past years R&D
* Step 5: Unamortized R&D shows up as asset, same amount as increase in book equity

Other capital investments
* Ad expesnes at consumer product company to build brand
* Recruiting and training expenses at consulting firms to build consulting practice
* Exploration costs for oil company
* Customer acquisition costs for a subcriber based company

## Session 5A

Examples of accounting inconsistencies

## Session 6

### Financial Ratios

#### Profit Margins
![Profit Margins](/assets/images/profit-margins.png)

* Contribution margin: How profitable company is on an additional unit that it sells? (= Contribution profit / sales)
Contribution profit = Revenues - variable COGS
* Gross margin: Direct measure of marginal profitability. accounts for all COGS (variable and fixed)
* Operating margin: Measures profitability after other operating expenses (such as SG&A) have been removed from Gross Profit. Companies with high gross margin and low op margin should see operating profits as they scale up
* EBITDA margin: Rough measure of opearting cash flows. Companies with high EBITDA margin have ability to generate cash from business
* Net margin: How profitable is this business to equity investors? Kinda noisy to interpret due to mix of operating model, taxes and financing (debt)

#### Accoutning Returns

Measures returns on capital invested instead of revenues

* Return on Equity = Net income / Equity invested in company
* Return on Invested Capital = Op income * (1 - tax rate) / (Equity invested in company + Debt - Cash & marketable securities)

#### Efficiency Ratios

Measures revenue generated from reinvesting back into the business

* Working capital turnover = Revenues / Non-cash Working Capital
* Asset turnover = Revenues / Total Assets
* Capital turnover = Revenues / Invested Capital

#### Measuring Financial Leverage

How much has a company borrowed? Measured using debt ratios

* Debt to Capital = Debt / (Debt + equity)
* Debt to Equity = Debt / Equity
* Debt to EBITDA = Debt / EBITDA

There are some choices to be made about the type of debt to be used in these ratios

#### Measuring Liquity / Credit Risk

* Coverage ratios
  * Interest coverage ratio: Op income / interest expense. Higher number implies buffer for risk. Lower implies more risk.
  * Fixed charge coverage ratio: Op income + fixed charges / interest expense. Measures same as above

* Liquidity Ratios
  * Current ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilites. Higher means company has assets to pay off liabilities (safe)
  * Quick ratio = Current Assets - Inventory / Current Liabilities. Numerator includes only liquid assets.
